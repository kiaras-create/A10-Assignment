## Assignment Reflection

Please reflect on your experience with this assignment. What was most challenging? What was most interesting?  What did you learn that you might use again?

Chiashi Yang - I found the task of reading files and parsing the lines to be the most challenging. Although I have done this before for previous assignments, it was still difficult for me to figure out the logic. I had to use Geeks for Geeks to better understand what to do. I especially enjoyed coding the hash table containing the ASCII keys and the corresponding bit pattern values. I learned how to write code to encode plain text, and I also continued my learning in reading/parsing files. This will be helpful for future coding assignments and good knowledge overall. I wish the instructions were more clear, as I found it confusing that some methods' return values weren't specified. I had to infer on a lot of them.
