Any references used besides JavaDoc and course materials (including AI consultations): Geeks for Geeks

## Assignment Reflection

Please reflect on your experience with this assignment. What was most challenging? What was most interesting?  What did you learn that you might use again?
<<<<<<< HEAD
Shakila Jafari - This assignment was kind of challenging for me mostly figuring out how to build the Huffman tree from the file. I kept running into issues with traversal but it was nice to see the tree finally come together. I learned a lot about using a generic BinaryTree and inserting nodes based on patterns.

Chiashi Yang - I found the task of reading files and parsing the lines to be the most challenging. Although I have done this before for previous assignments, it was still difficult for me to figure out the logic. I had to use Geeks for Geeks to better understand what to do. I especially enjoyed coding the hash table containing the ASCII keys and the corresponding bit pattern values. I learned how to write code to encode plain text, and I also continued my learning in reading/parsing files. This will be helpful for future coding assignments and good knowledge overall. I wish the instructions were more clear, as I found it confusing that some methods' return values weren't specified. I had to infer on a lot of them. 

Kiara Sunil Singh - I found that understanding how to read and write the files were difficult to understand. This is because it utilized a lot of tree logic and took a while to understand. I found that visually drawing out the methods helped me understand more about how they can funcion. This assignment reinforced the concept of traversing through trees and helped me understand more about how tree logic works and why it can be useful in different scenarios. I also wish that the instructions were more specific/clear in some areas as it was hard for me to understand what was expected for some methods and files.
